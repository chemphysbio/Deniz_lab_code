# Deniz_lab_code
This repo contains code written for the Deniz lab at Scripps Research. 

The "wrangling" package includes some utilities code and three subpackages: nanodrop, fluorimeter, and b2core_plate_fluorimeter. **Only the nanodrop subpackage has been tested.** 

wrangling/nanodrop also contains a Jupyter notebook "Guide for Non-Coders" to help you process yourdata even if you don't know python.
